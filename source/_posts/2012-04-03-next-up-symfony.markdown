So, I've decided it was time to learn some PHP. I mean, phpinfo() and include()
are all I really need to know right? _Wrong_.

Thus, I have decided it is time to sit down and learn a bit of PHP. Now that I've
reached that decision, where to start? What better place than a framework that
I hear good things about, is supposedly similar to Rails, and I know a lot of
my friends use?

And so it begins...

I'll try to track my success/failure here, but no promises. Because _everyone_
knows how frequently I actually post, not to mention the fine quality of said
posts. [_sic_]
